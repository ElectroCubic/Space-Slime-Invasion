# Space Slime Invasion
## Can you Survive the Invasion? 

This game was made during the GameDevUtopia x Defold Game Jam.
Hosted by GameDevUtopia. We hope you enjoy playing this outer space fantasy platformer and shooter game!!
Play in Full Screen for best experience. Have fun! ^^

## About the Game:
This is our first ever game jam submission and we made this game in the Defold game engine in 3 days, and we had no prior experience working with Defold, so it was a challenging task for both of us to learn and create something for the game jam.

The gameplay is mostly based on a platformer, with a slight twist of space shooter genre. The game contains 3 levels in increasing order of difficulty. 

*P.S. - We were also planning to have cutscenes and dialogs in the game to highlight the game's lore, but unfortunately we had to scrap them due to limited time duration :'(*


## Storyline of the Game:
For those people who are interested in the lore, you can interpret the story in however way you like, but the main story revolves around you, the player, travelling to a far-away galaxy in cryo-sleep, and suddenly you are invaded by dangerous Space Slimes.

These slimes look harmless at first glance but their their body is poisonous in nature and very lethal to a human being. The space shuttle activated its spike and saw defense mechanism to prevent the intruders from entering your space shuttle. But alas, the slimes remain unaffected by it. So in order to defend yourself, you have to reach the space shuttle's defense turret and defend against hoards of enemy spaceships attacking your space shuttle. 

But the enemies outnumber you and they call their mothership for backup. They leave you with no choice other than escaping from the enemy by activating the Slip-drive. You have to act quickly to find and activate the Slip-drive to reach safely back to your Home planet. The survival of man-kind depends upon you... so make your every action count!
